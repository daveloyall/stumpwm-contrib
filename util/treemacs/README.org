# TREEMACS

This is an emacs-like toy that runs atop StumpWM.  "Emacs-like" means
"in the spirit of emacs", which in turn means "edit the editor with
the editor", rather than "the default keybindings are somewhat like
the default keybindings of emacs".

What is generally atop a stump?  A tree, of course!  Thus the name.

* TODO find code that stumpwm uses for `C-t ;` and other command which implement line editing and borrow it.
* TODO find code that implements keybinding and borrow it.  It already has "modes".
* TODO determine if stumpwm already is treemacs... :)
